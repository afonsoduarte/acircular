# Stacey 3.0.0 + Bourbon Neat

This is a fork of [Stacey app 3.0.0](https://github.com/kolber/stacey). Its features:

- modified Markdown parser to preserve line breaks (ala GitHub)
- HTML5 template that uses [Bourbon Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat) (and therefore [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/))
- .md and .txt files rendered as page variables (this is a workaround for [this issue](https://github.com/kolber/stacey/issues/44) )
